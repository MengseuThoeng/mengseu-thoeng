        {/* Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>{siteConfig.author}</strong>, and I've been
        passionate about coding since I was a child. I fell in love with
        programming at a young age, spending countless hours learning,
        experimenting, and creating small projects. Over the years, this passion
        has grown into a career as a Full Stack developer, where I continue to
        build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. */}
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Thoeng Mengseu, but you can call me Reki. Iâ€™m a 21-year-old Software Engineering enthusiast with a lifelong passion for technology. My love for coding started when I was around 12 or 13 years old, and it has grown into a core part of who I am. From exploring the latest tech gadgets to building innovative solutions, I thrive on creativity and problem-solving.

        {/* As Iâ€™ve evolved in my career, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into new areas
        like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), diving deep
        into neural networks and other cutting-edge technologies. But no matter
        how much I learn, I always keep that same excitement and curiosity I had
        as a child, exploring new fields and technologies that push the
        boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. */}
        Iâ€™m currently working on platforms like CodeAdvisors, a tool to help administrators at ISTAD manage student information more efficiently. My expertise includes Spring Boot microservices, Next.js with TypeScript, and a tech stack that leverages Kafka, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch. Iâ€™m all about creating scalable, impactful software that makes life easier.

        {/* Today, Iâ€™m not just focused on building apps and websites; Iâ€™m also
        exploring DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize and
        scale my projects. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m
        always looking for new challenges that help me expand my skills. */}
        Outside of coding, I have a happy and optimistic vibe, and I believe in balancing work with creativity, whether itâ€™s through music, exploring business ideas, or diving into my favorite anime, Freiren. If youâ€™re looking to collaborate or just want to chat about tech, letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together! ðŸš€
